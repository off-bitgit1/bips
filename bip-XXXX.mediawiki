This BIP is a modification of [[bip-0021.mediawiki|BIP 0021]] to add information about the modern usage of bitcoin: URIs as well as provide forward-looking guidance on how to incorporate new payment instructions. BIP 21 was based on BIP 20, which was, in turn based off an earlier document by Nils Schneider.

==Abstract==
This BIP proposes a URI scheme for making Bitcoin payments.

==Motivation==
The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or scanning QR Codes.

==Specification==

=== General rules for handling (important!) ===

Bitcoin clients MUST NOT act on URIs without getting the user's authorization.
They SHOULD require the user to manually approve each payment individually, though in some cases they MAY allow the user to automatically make this decision.

=== Operating system integration ===
Graphical bitcoin clients SHOULD register themselves as the handler for the "bitcoin:" URI scheme by default, if no other handler is already registered. If there is already a registered handler, they MAY prompt the user to change it once when they first run the client.

=== General Format ===

Bitcoin URIs follow the general format for URIs as set forth in RFC 3986. The path component consists of a bitcoin address, and the query component provides additional payment options.

Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range. These must first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986.

=== ABNF grammar ===

(See also [[#Simpler syntax|a simpler representation of syntax]])

 bitcoinurn     = "bitcoin:" [ bitcoinaddress ] [ "?" bitcoinparams ]
 bitcoinaddress = *base58 / *bech32 / *bech32m
 bitcoinparams  = bitcoinparam [ "&" bitcoinparams ]
 bitcoinparam   = [ amountparam / labelparam / messageparam / otherparam / reqparam ]
 amountparam    = "amount=" *digit [ "." *digit ]
 labelparam     = "label=" *qchar
 messageparam   = "message=" *qchar
 otherparam     = qchar *qchar [ "=" *qchar ]
 reqparam       = "req-" qchar *qchar [ "=" *qchar ]

Here, "qchar" corresponds to valid characters of an RFC 3986 URI query component, excluding the "=" and "&" characters, which this BIP takes as separators.

The scheme component ("bitcoin:") is case-insensitive, and implementations must accept any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The query parameter keys are also case-insensitive. Query parameter values and bitcoin address fields may be case-sensitive depending on their content.

=== Bitcoin Address ===

The bitcoinaddress body MUST be either a base58 P2SH or P2PKH address, bech32 Segwit version 0 address, bech32m Segwit address, or empty. Future address formats SHOULD instead be placed in query keys as optional payment instructions to provide backwards compatibility during upgrade cycles. After new address types are near-universally supported, or for recipients wishing to avoid a standard on-chain fallback, the bitcoinaddress part of the URI MAY be left empty.

=== Query Keys ===

The following keys are defined generally and apply to any URI regardless of payment instructions:

*label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)
*address: bitcoin address
*message: message that describes the transaction to the user ([[#Examples|see examples below]])

The following keys are currently defined for payment instructions of various forms:

*lightning: Lightning BOLT 11 invoices
*lno: Lightning BOLT12 offers
*sp: Silent Payment addresses

New payment instructions using bech32 or bech32m encodings SHOULD reuse their address format's Human Readable Part as the parameter key.

==== Transfer amount ====

If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal BTC.
All amounts MUST contain no commas and use a period (.) as the separating character to separate whole numbers and decimal fractions.
I.e. amount=50.00 or amount=50 is treated as 50 BTC, and amount=50,000.00 is invalid.

Bitcoin clients MAY display the amount in any format that is not intended to deceive the user.
They SHOULD choose a format that is foremost least confusing, and only after that most reasonable given the amount requested.
For example, so long as the majority of users work in BTC units, values should always be displayed in BTC by default, even if mBTC or TBC would otherwise be a more logical interpretation of the amount.
== Rationale ==

===Payment identifiers, not person identifiers===
Best practices are that a unique address should be used for every transaction on-chain.
Therefore, a URI which contains an on-chain payment address MUST NOT represent an exchange of personal information, but a one-time payment instruction. URIs which represent only reusable non-address-reusing payment instructions (like Lightning BOLT12 offers or Silent Payments) MAY be reused as a wallet sees fit.

===Accessibility (URI scheme name)===
Should someone from the outside happen to see such a URI, the URI scheme name already gives a description.
A quick search should then do the rest to help them find the resources needed to make their payment.
Other proposed names sound much more cryptic; the chance that someone googles that out of curiosity are much slimmer.
Also, very likely, what he will find are mostly technical specifications - not the best introduction to bitcoin.

==Forward compatibility==
Variables which are prefixed with a req- are considered required.  If a client does not implement any variables which are prefixed with req-, it MUST consider the entire URI invalid.  Any other variables which are not implemented, but which are not prefixed with a req-, can be safely ignored.

As future new address types should be added using query parameters rather than the `bitcoinaddress` field, URIs can seamlessly support many payment instructions while senders only support legacy instructions. This allows for senders to be able to pay newer recipients while still allowing the use of more modern payment instruction formats.

==Backward compatibility==
As this BIP is written, several clients already implement a bitcoin: URI scheme similar to this one, however usually without the additional "req-" prefix requirement.  Thus, it is recommended that additional variables prefixed with req- not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6 months from the finalization of this BIP has passed in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade.

Compared to BIP 21, this document describes standard query parameters containing payment instructions, allows bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields, and allow for future URIs with an empty `bitcoinaddress` field. Use of bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields were long-since common practice in 2024, and the `lightning` query parameter storing BOLT 11 payment instructions became common practice in the year or three leading up to 2024. Inclusion of standard query parameters was added to provide guidance on query parameter usage going forward.

Any existing BIP 21 implementation should automatically be fully compliant with this BIP, as the changes only describe existing practice or impact future address format inclusion.

== Appendix ==

=== Simpler syntax ===

This section is non-normative and does not cover all possible syntax.
Please see the BNF grammar above for the normative syntax.

[foo] means optional, &lt;bar&gt; are placeholders

 <nowiki>bitcoin:<address>[?amount=<amount>][?label=<label>][?message=<message>]</nowiki>

=== Examples ===

Just the address:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W

Address with name:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?label=Luke-Jr

Request 20.30 BTC to "Luke-Jr":
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=20.3&label=Luke-Jr

Request 50 BTC with message:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=50&label=Luke-Jr&message=Donation%20for%20project%20xyz

Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 11 invoice with a fallback to on-chain payments:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?lightning=lnbc420bogusinvoice

Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 11 invoice with no fallback:
 bitcoin:?lightning=lnbc420bogusinvoice

Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 12 offer with no fallback:
 bitcoin:?lno=lno1bogusoffer

Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 12 offer or silent payments address with no fallback:
 bitcoin:?lno=lno1bogusoffer&sp=sp1qsilentpayment

Request funds to be paid to a silent payments address with no fallback:
 bitcoin:?sp=sp1qsilentpayment

Request funds to be paid to a silent payments address with a fallback:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?sp=sp1qsilentpayment

Some future version that has variables which are (currently) not understood and required and thus invalid:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?req-somethingyoudontunderstand=50&req-somethingelseyoudontget=999

Some future version that has variables which are (currently) not understood but not required and thus valid:
 bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?somethingyoudontunderstand=50&somethingelseyoudontget=999

Characters must be URI encoded properly.

== Reference Implementations ==
=== Bitcoin clients ===
